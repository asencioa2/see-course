          <li>
            <h3>Long-term Viability:</h3>
            <p>Ethical practices contribute to the sustainability of software projects. By avoiding shortcuts or questionable tactics, software engineers create a solid foundation for long-term success.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Core Principles of Software Engineering Ethics:</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li>
            <h3>Transparency and Honesty:</h3>
            <p>Engineers should be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of their software. They must provide accurate information to stakeholders and users.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Integrity:</h3>
            <p>Software engineers should act with integrity, meaning they should be honest and fair in their dealings. This includes not misrepresenting facts, respecting intellectual property, and avoiding conflicts of interest.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Respect for Privacy:</h3>
            <p>Upholding privacy rights is paramount. Engineers should handle sensitive data responsibly and obtain proper consent when collecting, storing, or processing personal information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Accountability:</h3>
            <p>Engineers should take responsibility for their work. This involves acknowledging and rectifying mistakes, as well as ensuring that software meets the required quality standards.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering:</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li>
            <h3>Balancing Innovation and Safety:</h3>
            <p>Engineers may face the dilemma of pushing boundaries to innovate while ensuring the safety and reliability of the software.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Data Privacy vs. Functionality:</h3>
            <p>Developers must strike a balance between providing robust functionality and safeguarding users' data and privacy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Open Source vs. Proprietary Software:</h3>
            <p>Choosing between open-source and proprietary solutions involves considering the broader ethical implications of accessibility, ownership, and community contributions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Responsibility for AI and Automation:</h3>
            <p>With the rise of AI, engineers need to grapple with issues like algorithmic bias, fairness, and the potential consequences of autonomous systems.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Establishing a Framework for Ethical Decision-Making:</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li>
            <h3>Utilitarianism:</h3>
            <p>This approach evaluates the consequences of an action, aiming to maximize overall happiness or minimize overall harm. In software development, this might involve considering the impact on users, stakeholders, and society at large.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Deontology:</h3>
