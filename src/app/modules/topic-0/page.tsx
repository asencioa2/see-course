          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Requirements Engineering:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: This phase involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. It lays the foundation for the entire development process.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Clear and accurate requirements are essential for building software that meets user expectations and business needs.</p>          
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Software Design:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: In this phase, the system&rsquo;s architecture and design are planned based on the gathered requirements. It includes defining the structure, components, modules, interfaces, and data for the system.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Effective design ensures that the software is scalable, maintainable, and capable of meeting its functional and non-functional requirements.</p>          
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Coding/Implementation:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: This is the phase where the actual code is written based on the design specifications. It involves translating the design into a programming language.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Proper coding practices contribute to software reliability, readability, and ease of maintenance.</p>    
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Software Testing:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: Testing involves systematically evaluating the software to identify and fix defects. It includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Rigorous testing ensures the software&rsquo;s correctness, reliability, and robustness.</p>    
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Software Maintenance:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: After deployment, software undergoes maintenance to address bugs, add new features, and adapt to changing requirements.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Maintenance is crucial for keeping software up-to-date, secure, and aligned with evolving user needs.</p>    
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Principles of Software Engineering:</h2>
        <ol className="ml-2">
          <li>
            <h3>Modularity:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: Breaking down a system into smaller, manageable units or modules. Each module performs a specific function and can be developed and tested independently.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Modularity enhances code reusability, simplifies testing, and facilitates collaboration among developers.</p>    
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Abstraction:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential properties and ignoring unnecessary details.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Abstraction allows developers to manage complexity, understand high-level concepts, and improve overall system comprehension.</p>    
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Encapsulation promotes information hiding, reducing dependencies between different parts of the software.</p>    
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Hierarchy:</h3>
            <p className='ml-4'>Explanation: Organizing software components in a hierarchical structure, typically using concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.</p>
            <p className='ml-4'>Importance: Hierarchy simplifies system design, promotes code reuse, and enhances maintainability.</p>
